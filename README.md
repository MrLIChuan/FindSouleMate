# FindSouleMate
A small application about Find a soule mate, writen by C

A happy, long-lasting relationship with our soulmate is something I imagine most of us aspire to when we’re proactively dating or dreaming about a potential romance . . . especially when we’re dating over 60. Finally, it’s time for us to begin a new, fulfilling life with that special someone.

We all know the term “soulmate”.

A soulmate goes way beyond a life partner – someone you get along very well with and will live a happy, comfortable life with – also an admirable relationship to search for, but some may say you’re settling, if you’re seeking a life partner and not your soulmate.

Finding your soulmate is the ultimate in a relationship . . . someone with whom you’re utterly compatible and so deeply in tune that you seem to think the same thoughts and feel their feelings.

Both of your souls and beings are inexorably intertwined and in sync. You’re a perfect fit. This is the person you feel you were destined to be with.

Many of us who are dating again later in life have to suffer through some bad relationships before we’re ready for, or come in contact with, our soulmates.

Sometimes we happily settle into life-partner relationships that satisfy on many levels, and meet many of our needs.

I like to think that when we’re older, we have the emotional wherewithal and freedom to pursue a soulmate relationship. At least I hope there are plenty of us out there who strive for such a relationship. For me, finding Cosmo in my 60’s has been worth the wait.

So with this practice system, we use C for base caculation for theirs information.

用Linux在saisir文件夹里打开，在运行界面输入指令
./saisir_profil 名字拼音无空格
回答问题结束以后会生成一个以你名字为文件名的txt文件。
同样的方式给你喜欢的人填一份（这个程序暂不支持同性恋，偷懒忘记写了，下次加），生成文件以后，把这两个人的txt文件拷贝去compare_profil文件夹. 然后输入指令，注意空格。
./compare_profil 你的名字 对方的名字
会车就出结果了，多少分可以算算，我把我自己的txt传上去了，没事可以和楼主配配对
